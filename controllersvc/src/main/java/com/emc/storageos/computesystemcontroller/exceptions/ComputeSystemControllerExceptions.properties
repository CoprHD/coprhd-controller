illegalInitiator=Initiator {1} is assigned to host {2} - Unable to assign to {0}.  Creation/discovery of a host within controller failed.\n\
  \n\
  Details: \n\
  \n\
  Controller has a reference to initiator {1} in the database, however it refers to another host.  It is likely that host {2} no longer exists\n\
  as a compute resource, or now exists as a re-deployed server since controller last discovered it.\n\
  \n\
  Remediation options are as follows:\n\
  \n\
  1. If host {2} no longer exists, rediscovering the virtual center and compute server will initiate clearing out the host from the controller database.\n\
  2. If host {2} still exists, but no longer utilitizes initiator {1}, rediscovering the virtual center and compute server will update the initiators from the controller database.\n\
     Another option is to remove the host object from Physical->Hosts if controller is not managing it.  Do not choose the detach storage option, as this may affect accessibility to storage.\n\
  3. Contact EMC Support for additional remediation paths.\n\
  \n\
  Additional Details:\n\
  \n\
  This occurred when comparing the existing controller-managed initiators against the newly-created (or discovered) initiators.\n\
  Since compute systems reuse virtual HBAs and their WWNs frequently, there is a chance that controller will have old references to initiators\n\
  that have since been re-used, causing this condition.\n\
  To prevent loss of storage, controller will not make assumptions on whether a server outside its management is still in use or not.
