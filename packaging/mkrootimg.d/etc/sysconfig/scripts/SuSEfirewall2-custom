# the hooks which are supplied to load customized iptables rules.

# IT IS USEFUL TO CROSS-READ /sbin/SuSEfirewall2 TO SEE HOW HOOKS WORK !

# Note: always use iptables resp ip6tables without path. You are not actually
# calling the binary here. SuSEfirewall2 internally defines an alias to
# collect all rules and apply them in batch later. Set
# FW_USE_IPTABLES_BATCH="no" if you need the rules to be applied
# immediately.

    # ports before the SuSEfirewall2 generated rules are hit.

#example: always filter backorifice/netbus trojan connect requests and log them.
