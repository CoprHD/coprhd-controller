3.  LICENSE TERMS.
A.  General License Grant.  Subject to Customer&apos;s compliance with this
Agreement, the Product Notice, and payment of all license fees, EMC grants to
Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable (except as otherwise permitted
herein) license (with no right to sublicense) to use (i) Software for Customer&apos;s
internal business purposes; and (ii) the Documentation related to Software for
the purpose of supporting Customer&apos;s use of Software. Licenses granted to
Customer shall, unless otherwise indicated on the Product Notice or quote from
EMC or Distributor) be perpetual and commence on Delivery of the physical media
or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable.
Documentation is licensed solely for purposes of supporting Customer&apos;s use of
Software as permitted in this Section. To the extent applicable to Software,
Customer may be required to follow EMC&apos;s then current product registration
process, if any, to obtain and input an authorization key or license file.
B.  Licensing Models.  Software is licensed for use only in accordance with the
commercial terms and restrictions of the Software&apos;s relevant licensing model,
which are stated in the Product Notice and/or quote from EMC or Distributor. For
example, the licensing model may provide that Software is licensed for use
solely (i) for a certain number of licensing units; (ii) on or in connection
with certain hardware, or a CPU, network or other hardware environment; and/or
(iii) for a specified amount of storage capacity. Microcode, firmware or
operating system software required to enable the hardware with which it is
shipped to perform its basic functions, is licensed for use solely on such
hardware.
C.  License Restrictions.  All Software licenses granted herein are for use of
object code only. Customer is permitted to copy Software as necessary to install
and run it in accordance with the license, but otherwise for back-up purposes
only. Customer may copy Documentation insofar as reasonably necessary in
connection with Customer&apos;s authorized internal use of Software. Customer shall
not, without EMC&apos;s prior written consent (i) use Software in a service bureau,
application service provider or similar capacity; or (ii) disclose to any third
party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses, benchmark testing
or analyses of Software performed by or on behalf of Customer; (iii) make
available Software in any form to anyone other than Customer&apos;s employees or
contractors; or (iv) transfer Software to an Affiliate or a third party.
D.  Software Releases.  Software Releases shall be subject to the license terms
applicable to Software.
E.  Audit Rights.  EMC (including its independent auditors) shall have the right
to audit Customer&apos;s usage of Software to confirm compliance with the agreed
terms. Such audit is subject to reasonable advance notice by EMC and shall not
unreasonably interfere with Customer&apos;s business activities. Customer will
provide EMC with the support required to perform such audit and will, without
prejudice to other rights of EMC, address any non-compliant situations
identified by the audit by forthwith procuring additional licenses.
F.  Termination.  EMC may terminate licenses for cause, if Customer breaches the
terms governing use of Software and fails to cure within thirty (30) days after
receipt of EMC&apos;s written notice thereof. Upon termination of a license, Customer
shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable Software
(including copies) to EMC.
G.  Reserved Rights.  All rights not expressly granted to Customer are reserved.
In particular, no title to, or ownership of, the Software is transferred to
Customer. Customer shall reproduce and include copyright and other proprietary
notices on and in any copies of the Software. Unless expressly permitted by
applicable mandatory law, Customer shall not modify, enhance, supplement, create
derivative works from, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile or
otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software without EMC&apos;s prior written
consent, nor shall Customer permit any third party to do the same.

4.  WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.
A.  Software Warranty.  EMC warrants that Software will substantially conform to
the applicable Documentation for such Software and that any physical media
provided by EMC will be free from manufacturing defects in materials and
workmanship until the expiration of the warranty period. EMC does not warrant
that the operation of Software shall be uninterrupted or error free, that all
defects can be corrected, or that Software meets Customer&apos;s requirements, except
if expressly warranted by EMC in its quote. Support Services from EMC for
Software are available for separate purchase and the Support Options are
identified at the Product Notice.
B.  Warranty Duration.  Unless otherwise stated on the EMC quote, the warranty
period for Software shall (i) be as set forth at the Product Notice; and (ii)
commence upon Delivery of the media or the date Customer is notified of
electronic availability, as applicable.
C.  Customer Remedies.  EMC&apos;s entire liability and Customer&apos;s exclusive remedies
under the warranties described in this section shall be for EMC, at its option,
to remedy the non-compliance or to replace the affected Software. If EMC is
unable to effect such within a reasonable time, then EMC shall refund the amount
received by EMC for the Software concerned. All replaced Software contained on
physical media supplied by EMC shall be returned to and become the property of
EMC. EMC shall have no liability hereunder after expiration of the applicable
warranty period. The foregoing shall not void any supplementary remedies made
available to Customer by a Distributor, with respect to which EMC shall have no
liability or obligation.
D.  Warranty Exclusions.  Warranty does not cover problems that arise from (i)
accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any third party items
or services with which Software is used or other causes beyond EMC&apos;s control;
(iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance with EMC&apos;s instructions
or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an environment, in a manner or for
a purpose for which Software was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration
or repair by anyone other than EMC or its authorized representatives;. EMC has
no obligation whatsoever for Software installed or used beyond the licensed use,
or whose original identification marks have been altered or removed. Removal or
disablement of remote support capabilities during the warranty period requires
reasonable notice to EMC. Such removal or disablement, or improper use or
failure to use applicable Customer Support Tools shall be subject to a surcharge
in accordance with EMC&apos;s then current standard rates.
E.  No Further Warranties.  Except for the warranty set forth herein, and to the
maximum extent permitted by law, EMC (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING
WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

5.  SUPPORT SERVICES.
A.  Support Services.  If Customer has purchased Support Services for Software
(or its related hardware, if any) directly from EMC, such shall be delivered by
EMC as specified in the applicable Product Notice. If Customer has purchased
maintenance and support from a Distributor, then EMC may provide Support
Services to the extent that the Distributor has contracted with EMC to provide
Customer with Support Services.
B.  Reinstatement of Lapsed Support.  If Support Services expire or are
terminated, and Customer subsequently seeks to reinstate Support Services,
Customer shall pay: (i) the cumulative Support Services fees applicable for the
period during which Support Services lapsed; (ii) the annual support fees for
the then-current current period; and (iii) the then-current reinstatement fee
and/or certification fees, as quoted by EMC or a Distributor.
C.  Support Tools.  EMC may use Support Tools or may make certain Support Tools
available to assist Customer in performing various maintenance or support
related tasks. Customer shall use Support Tools only in accordance with the
terms under which EMC makes such available.
D.  Additional Support Terms.  Unless otherwise indicated in the Product Notice,
Support Services provided by EMC shall consist of (i) using commercially
reasonable efforts to remedy failures of Software to perform substantially in
accordance with EMC&apos;s applicable Documentation; (ii) providing English-language
(or where available, local language help line service (via telephone or other
electronic media); and (iii) providing, or enabling Customer to download
Software Releases and Documentation updates made generally available by EMC at
no additional charge to other purchasers of Support Service for the applicable
Software.
E.  Software Releases.  Upon use of a Software Release, Customer shall remove
and make no further use of all prior Software Releases, and protect such prior
Software Releases from disclosure or use by any third party. Customer is
authorized to retain a copy of each Software Release properly obtained by
Customer for Customer&apos;s archive purposes and use such as a temporary back-up if
the current Software Release becomes inoperable. Customer shall use and deploy
Software Releases strictly in accordance with terms of the original license for
the Software.
F.  Support Services for Software affected by Change in Hardware Status.  For
Software used on or operated in connection with hardware that ceases to be
covered by Support Services or the EMC hardware warranty, EMC reserves the right
to send Customer written notice that EMC has either chosen to discontinue or
change the price for Support Services for such Software (with such price change
effective as of the date the applicable EMC hardware ceases to be so covered).
If EMC sends a discontinuation notice, or if Customer rejects or does not
respond to the notice of a proposed price change within thirty (30) days after
receipt, Customer will be deemed to have terminated the Support Services for its
convenience.
G.  Support Services Exclusions.  Support Services do not cover problems that
arise from (i) accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any
third party items or services with which the Software is used or other causes
beyond EMC&apos;s control; (iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance
with EMC&apos;s instructions or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an
environment, in a manner or for a purpose for which the Software or its related
hardware was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration or repair by anyone
other than EMC or its authorized designees. EMC has no obligation whatsoever for
Software installed or used beyond the licensed use. Removal or disablement of
Software&apos;s remote support capabilities during the term of Support Services
requires reasonable notice to EMC. Customer&apos;s removal, disablement of remote
support capabilities, or improper use of or failure to use Support Tools made
available to Customer shall subject Customer to a surcharge in accordance with
EMC&apos;s then current standard rates.

6.  INDEMNITY.  EMC shall (i) defend Customer against any third party claim that
Software or Support Services infringes a patent or copyright existing in the
country in which EMC is located, the United States of America or the European
Union; and (ii) pay the resulting costs and damages finally awarded against
Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction or the amounts stated in a written
settlement negotiated by EMC. The foregoing obligations are subject to the
following: Customer (a) notifies EMC promptly in writing of such claim; (b)
grants EMC sole control over the defense and settlement thereof; (c) reasonably
cooperates in response to an EMC request for assistance; and (d) is not in
material breach of this Agreement. Should any such Software or Support Service
become, or in EMC&apos;s opinion be likely to become, the subject of such a claim,
EMC may, at its option and expense, (1) procure for Customer the right to make
continued use thereof; (2) replace or modify such so that it becomes non-
infringing; (3) request return of the Software and, upon receipt thereof; refund
the price paid by Customer, less straight-line depreciation based on a three (3)
year useful life for Software; or (4) discontinue the Support Service and refund
the portion of any pre-paid Support Service fee that corresponds to the period
of Support Service discontinuation. EMC shall have no liability to the extent
that the alleged infringement arises out of or relates to: (A) the use or
combination of Software or Support Service with third party products or
services; (B) use for a purpose or in a manner for which the Software or Support
Service was not designed; (C) any modification made by any person other than EMC
or its authorized representatives; (D) any modifications to Software or Support
Service made by EMC pursuant to Customer&apos;s specific instructions; (E) any
technology owned or licensed by Customer from third parties; or (F) use of any
older version of the Software when use of a newer Software Release made
available to Customer would have avoided the infringement. THIS SECTION STATES
CUSTOMER&apos;S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND EMC&apos;S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY
INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.

7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
A.  Limitation on Direct Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS ARISING UNDER
SECTION 6 ABOVE, EMC&apos;S TOTAL LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER&apos;S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY
FOR ANY CLAIM OF ANY TYPE WHATSOEVER, ARISING OUT OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICE
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, SHALL BE LIMITED TO PROVEN DIRECT DAMAGES CAUSED BY EMC&apos;S
SOLE NEGLIGENCE IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED (i) US$1,000,000, FOR DAMAGE TO REAL
OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY; AND (ii) THE PRICE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO EMC FOR
THE SPECIFIC SERVICE (CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, WHEN APPLICABLE) OR
SOFTWARE FROM WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES, FOR DAMAGE OF ANY TYPE NOT IDENTIFIED IN
(i) ABOVE OR OTHERWISE EXCLUDED HEREUNDER.
B.  No Indirect Damages.  EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS REGARDING VIOLATION OF
EMC&apos;S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR CLAIMS ARISING UNDER SECTION 6 ABOVE,
NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR EMC SHALL HAVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA AND/OR USE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY THEREOF.
C.  Special Exclusion.  IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR
EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ALL OR A PORTION OF SECTION
7.A AND/OR 7.B ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY.
D.  Regular Back-ups.  As part of its obligation to mitigate damages, Customer
shall take reasonable data back-up measures. In particular, Customer shall back-
up the relevant data before EMC performs any remedial, upgrade, new Software
Release or other works on Customer&apos;s production systems. To the extent EMC&apos;s
liability for loss of data is not anyway excluded under this Agreement, EMC
shall in case of data losses only be liable for the typical effort to recover
the data which would have accrued if Customer had appropriately backed up its
data.
E.  Limitation Period.  Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the
limitation period for claims for damages shall be eighteen (18) months after the
cause of action accrues, unless statutory law provides for a shorter limitation
period.
F.  Suppliers.  The foregoing limitations shall also apply in favor of EMC&apos;s
suppliers.

8.  EVALUATION AND LOANED SOFTWARE.
A.  This Agreement shall also apply to (i) &quot;Evaluation Software&quot; (meaning the
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are
licensed for a limited duration for the specific purpose of evaluation prior to
making a final decision on procurement; and (ii) &quot;Loaned Software&quot; (meaning the
copy of Software which contains this Agreement, including any copies made by or
on behalf of Customer, and all Documentation for the foregoing, which are
licensed for a limited duration directly  to Customer for a limited period of
time at no charge), subject to the following:
B.  The particular Evaluation or Loaned Software, period of use, Installation
Site and other transaction-specific conditions shall be as mutually agreed
between EMC and Customer and recorded in the form of an evaluation or loan
schedule.
C.  Notwithstanding any deviating terms in this Agreement, all licenses for
Evaluation and Loaned Software expire at the end of the evaluation or loan
period.
D.  Customer shall return Evaluation and Loaned Software at the end of the
evaluation or loan period or when sooner terminated by EMC for convenience by
giving thirty (30) days&apos; written notice, whichever occurs first. Customer shall
bear the risk of loss and damage for return of physical media, if any, and de-
installation.
E.  Customer may use Evaluation and Loaned Software free of charge, but, in the
case of Evaluation Software, solely for the purpose of evaluation and not in a
production environment.
F.  Without prejudice to any other limitations on EMC&apos;s liability set forth in
this Agreement (which shall also apply to Evaluation and Loaned Software),
Evaluation and Loaned Software are provided &quot;AS IS&quot; and any warranty or damage
claims against EMC in connection with Evaluation and Loaned Software are hereby
excluded, except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct of EMC.
G.  Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by EMC, EMC does not provide
maintenance or support for any Evaluation Software. CUSTOMER RECOGNIZES THAT
EVALUATION SOFTWARE MAY HAVE DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES WHICH CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE
CORRECTED BY EMC. EMC shall have no liability to Customer for any action (or any
prior related claims) brought by or against Customer alleging that Customer&apos;s
sale, use or other disposition of any Evaluation Software infringes any patent,
copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right. In event of such
an action, EMC retains the right to terminate this Agreement and take possession
of the Evaluation Software. THIS SECTION STATES EMC&apos;S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH
RESPECT TO ALLEGED INFRINGEMENTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY EVALUATION
SOFTWARE OR ANY PART OF IT OR ITS OPERATION.

9.  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each party shall (i) use Confidential Information of the
other party only for the purposes of exercising rights or performing obligations
in connection with this Agreement; and (ii) use at least reasonable care to
protect from disclosure to any third parties any Confidential Information
disclosed by the other party for a period commencing upon the date of disclosure
until three (3) years thereafter, except with respect to Customer data to which
EMC may have access in connection with the provision of Services, which shall
remain Confidential Information until one of the exceptions stated in the above
definition of Confidential Information applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may disclose Confidential Information (a) to an Affiliate for the
purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights hereunder as long
as such Affiliate complies with the foregoing; and (b) if required by law
provided the receiving party has given the disclosing party prompt notice.

10.  GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND EXPORT CONTROL.  Software and the technology
included therein provided under this Agreement are subject to governmental
restrictions on (i) exports from the U.S.; (ii) exports from other countries in
which such Software and technology included therein may be produced or located;
(iii) disclosures of technology to foreign persons; (iv) exports from abroad of
derivative products thereof; and (v) the importation and/or use of such Software
and technology included therein outside of the United States or other countries
(collectively, &quot;Export Laws&quot;). Customer shall comply with all Export Laws and
EMC export policies to the extent such policies are made available to Customer
by EMC. Diversion contrary to U.S. law or other Export Laws is expressly
prohibited.

11.  TERMINATION.  Customer may terminate this Agreement for its convenience
upon thirty (30) days&apos; notice to EMC. Either Customer or EMC may terminate this
Agreement upon written notice due to the other party&apos;s material breach of the
terms governing use of the Software; provided that such breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days after the provision of written notice to the breaching
party specifying the nature of such breach. Upon termination of this Agreement,
Customer shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable
Software (including copies) to EMC. Any provision that by its nature or context
is intended to survive any termination or expiration, including but not limited
to provisions relating to payment of outstanding fees, confidentiality and
liability, shall so survive.

Customer, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement because of a
failure or delay in performing its obligations hereunder on account of any force
majeure event, such as strikes, riots, insurrection, terrorism, fires, natural
disasters, acts of God, war, governmental action, or any other cause which is
beyond the reasonable control of such party.
E.  Assignment.  Customer shall not assign this Agreement or any right or
delegate any performance without EMC&apos;s prior written consent, which consent

        2.  Section 7 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY).  This Section is deleted in its
entirety and replaced with:
             7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND PRESERVATION OF DATA.
                 A.  The entire aggregate liability of EMC (including its
suppliers) under or in connection with the supply of the Software or Service,
whether in tort (including negligence), for breach of contract,
misrepresentation or otherwise, is limited in respect of each event or a series
of events: (i) to the amounts actually paid by Customer for the Software or
Services which give rise to such liability during the twelve (12) month period
immediately preceding the date of the cause of action giving rise to such claim;
or (ii) Great British Pounds Sterling one million (1,000,000), whichever is the
greater amount. In no event shall EMC (including its suppliers) or Customer be
liable to the other or any other person or entity for loss of profits, loss of
revenue, loss of use or any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
license of the Software or the provision of Services, and the use, performance,
receipt or disposition of such Software or Services, even if such party has been
advised of the possibility of such damages or losses. Nothing in this Agreement
shall operate to exclude or restrict EMC&apos;s liability for: (a) death or personal
injury resulting from negligence; (b) breach of obligations arising from section
12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979; or (c) fraud.
                B.  CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS IN RESPECT OF PRESERVATION OF DATA.
During the Term of the Agreement, the Customer shall:
                  1) from a point in time prior to the point of failure, (i)
make full and/or incremental backups of data which allow recovery in an
application consistent form, and (ii) store such back-ups at an off-site
location sufficiently distant to avoid being impacted by the event(s) (e.g.
including but not limited to flood, fire, power loss, denial of access or air
crash) and affect the availability of data at the impacted site;
                  2) have adequate processes and procedures in place to restore
data back to a point in time and prior to point of failure, and in the event of
real or perceived data loss, provide the skills/backup and outage windows to
restore the data in question;
                  3) use anti-virus software, regularly install updates across
all data which is accessible across the network, and protect all storage arrays
against power surges and unplanned power outages with Uninterruptible Power
Supplies; and
                  4) ensure that all operating system, firmware, system utility
(e.g. but not limited to, volume management, cluster management and backup) and
patch levels are kept to EMC recommended versions and that any proposed changes
thereto shall be communicated to EMC in a timely fashion.
        3.  Section 12 (MISCELLANEOUS).  Add the following as new subsection I:
               I.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in entering
into this Agreement, it does not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect
of, any statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether
negligently or innocently made) of any person (whether party to this Agreement
or not) other than as expressly set out in this Agreement as a warranty. The
only remedy available to Customer for a breach of the warranties shall be for
breach of contract under the terms of this Agreement. Nothing in Section 7 shall
however operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud. No term of this
Agreement shall be enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
1999 by a person that is not a party to this Agreement. If any part of this
Agreement is held unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions shall
not be affected.

excluded such liability shall be subject to the other limitations and provisions
