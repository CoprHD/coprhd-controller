CoprHD
=====
CoprHD is an open software defined storage controller platform based on EMC's ViPR Controller. It enables management and automation of storage resources for block and file storage platforms.

CoprHD is out in "preview mode" right now for anyone to download and play with. Stay tuned for the announcement on when we are ready to start accepting code contributions.


Contributions
--------------
We are not currently accepting pull requests into the project.  Within the next several months we expect to accept contributions into the project.  This is a new venture for us here at EMC and represents our first instance of open sourcing a commercial product.  

We are still working out some details and plan on having our engineers utilize this branch as the main development branch.  In order to not have multiple masters out there we will standardize CoprHD on the next release of ViPR Controller which will be within the next few months.  Once this release goes out the CoprHD branch will become the main development branch for both CoprHD and ViPR Controller.
